## Do you using BEM?

### Yes and no. BEM is a methodology that avoids the intersection of class names for elements of an HTML page. In standard situations I use this methodology, but, in this project, the Css-Modules approach was used, which solves the problem of overlapping names. There is also the technology of the CSS in JS, which also solves this problem.
